**What enviroment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editir, and so on)?**

I am on windows on Visual Studio Code using terminal commands.


**Detail the sympton you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expect to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying 
"it doesn't work".**

The symptom I am seeing is that the terminal gives me an error that says:

error: file not found: TestBug.java
Usage: javac <options> <source files>
use --help for a list of possible options

I expected this to compile so then I can actually run the tests. This is an image of the error.

I ran that command to that I can run the test cases on TestBug.java, I already used the cd command to cd into the starter folder.


**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. that might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran.
 Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**

The current command I am running that produces this error is:

```
javac -cp ".;..\libs\junit-4.13.2.jar;..\libs\hamcrest-2.2.jar" TestBug.java
```

I ran that command to that I can compile the test cases on TestBug.java, I already used the cd command to cd into the starter folder, I am not sure what else to do. Can I get some guidance?
