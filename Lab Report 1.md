## How to Install VS Code:

For me, I already had VS code installed because of CSE 11, but I will still help guide in installing it.

**First Step:** You will have to go to [this website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and choose which system you are downloading VS code on. Then hit the  download button.

**Third Step:** You will then need to copy your cs15lsp23zz username so you can input it else where and press again reset password. Follow the directions the system tells you. After you reset your password you might have to wait a bit for it to activate.

Remember to follow the directions. When it tells you to input a new password, input one and this will be the one you use in the terminal when you're asked for one. After, the password is confirmed you will,again, have to wait for it to activate.


## Trying Some Commands:
---

**First Step:** Load up VS code. Open a new terminal by looking above and clicking terminal and then new terminal.

**Third Step:** Using the terminal, You can try inputting the following commands into the terminal and seeing that you get. They all do different things:

`cd`

`ls`

`ls <directory> where <directory> is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23abc`, where the abc is one of the other group membersâ€™ username

`cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/`

`cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt`

This is an example of mine.

In this picture cd is meant for changing directories, it is usually followed by a file name but in the screenshot there is nothing.
