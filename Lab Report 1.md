**Second Step:**
After that, you will click the button that begins with cs15lsp23zz, the zz will be your own combonation of two letters. After that you will click the reset password button. You will then need to copy your cs15lsp23zz username so you can input it else where and press again reset password.

**Third Step:** You can try inputting the following commands into the terminal and seeing that you get:
`cd ~`
`cd`
`ls -lat`
`ls -a`
`ls <directory> where <directory> is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23abc, where the abc is one of the other group membersâ€™ username`
`cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/`
`cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt`

This is an example of mine.
