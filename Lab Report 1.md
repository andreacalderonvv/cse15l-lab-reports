Remember to follow the directions. When it tells you to input a new password, input one and this will be the one you use in the terminal when you're asked for one. After, the password is confirmed you will, again, have to wait for it to activate.

**Third Step:** Using the terminal, You can try inputting the following commands into the terminal and seeing that you get. They all do different things.
Below the commands will me an example of them in use and what they do:

`cd`

`ls`

`cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/`

`cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt`

This is an example of mine.

In this screenshot, cat is reading the contents of the hello.txt file. ls shows the contents of the directory. In this picture cd is meant for changing 
directories, it is usually followed by a file name but in the screenshot there is nothing. cp copies the contents to another place that is specified. In the screenshot, no place is specified.
