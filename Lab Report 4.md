vim ListExamples.java <enter>

`x i 2 <esc> :wq <enter>`

The first set of commands runs vim and then when vim opened up, my cursor was already on the 1 of the index1 so I pressed x to delete it. Then I pressed i to enter insert mode and esc after to exit out of it. :wq was to save and quit vim.

## Run the Tests, Demonstrating That They Now Succeed:
